What is O2C Cycle?

The order to cash cycle, often abbreviated to O2C or OTC, is how your business receives, processes, manages, 
and completes customer orders. This means handling all aspects of the sale including shipping the items, collecting the payment, 
creating invoices, and reporting on the end-to-end process. The OTC impacts your bottom line and relationships with your customers, 
so the process must be well-optimized.



In O2C Cycle, 4 modules are involved:-
1. Inventory
2. Order Management
3. Account Receivable
4. General Ledger

Step 1). Create a new item.

Go to Inventory -> Items -> Choose an org -> Master Items

Give item name, description and then go to tools-> copy from finished goods and click apply, item will be created.
In ES, the new item comes from ERP through Item Interface, we do not create it by ourselves.

Ask N.D. for it as he has created  anew item in ESUAT.

The item information will be found in mtl_system_items_b -> base table. with segment1 as Item field.

Since no new item could be created, we are taking  '2881095885' with creation_date => 20-MAY-22 , as an example item to do the further steps.


We can assign an item to all the other orgs using Master Items form by going to this third tab on the left of the screen and then assign that item to the org to which we want.




Step 2). Add stock in Inventory for an item.

Since we have created the item, now it is available in our inventory and customer can now place
Order for it, so we would also need to have stock for that Item now for a particular org. (CAW)


For that, go to Inventory -> Transactions -> Misc transactions -> Choose CAW in ESUATA-Atleos -> Misc receipt.

Give the item, give subinv , give quantity , give account and now item stock is successfully increased.

Effected tables -> mtl_onhand_quantities_detail.

Mtl_transaction_quantities.


We can also see it on the onhand form.


The inventory periods are close, so in order to open them, we can go to 
Purchase Super User -> Setup -> Financials Accounting  -> Control Purchasing Periods


Since periods could not be opened in ESDEVA, we used ESUATA-Atleos for it. Took item '2881095885' in 'CAW'
 org, created misc transaction for it for AVL subinventory and added 100 parts to it. 

We can check the increased the quantity in mtl_onhand_quantities_detail table in the AVL sub for CAW org.




We can also check the quantity from the front-end using the onhand form.





Step 3). Since, we have added stock to the subinventory, now we are ready to get the orders from the customers.
For that we are going to create a Sales Order now.

Go to NCR Field Logistics SME User -> Order Management -> Sales Orders -> Choose the yellow icon -> Choose NCR_OU.

Choose Operating Unit as 'CA Field Operating Unit' -> Choose a customer with Ship to and Bill to 
(Zachary McCabe) -> Then save using Cntrl+S.

The order will start showing in the oe_order_headers_all table with status as Entered.

Sold_from_org_id is the operating unit's org id from hr_operating_units table.

Sold_to_org_id is the cust_account_id from hz_cust_accounts table.

Intially, the order flow status code will be in 'Entered' state.




Now, go to others , and you can change the order priority. We changed the shipment_priority_code from Regulat to OVERNIGHT.




It will also be reflected in the ooha.shipment_priority_code column.



As of now, there is no line for this header_id in the ooha table. It will be added once we add lines to this order.

Add ordered_item => 2881095885 and quantity=1 and save. It will start to show in oola.



Tried to book the order-> got the following error



Now, take one older order and try and replicate and book the new order in ESUATA-Atleos.


SALES ORDER IN ESDEVA…

We have taken the order-> 179942276 from ESUATA as template and trying to created SO in ESDEVA.

First, give the operating unit , then customer, then order type, then go to lines and enter ordered item having some onhand.

The availability for an item can be checked from 'availability' tab.

Till now, the flow status code for the order would be 'ENTERED' in ooha and oola tables.

Now, we are going to BOOK the order.

Click on 'Book' button, the order will be booked if no errors are there.


The order -> 180816143 has been booked in ESDEVA.




The flow status code will be changed in oola and ooha tables.






Go to 'Shipping Transactions' and see.

-- The flow should be that an order should be in the 'Booked' status on the header level and 'awaiting shipping' status on the line level but my order in in the 'Booked' status on the line level as well due to which there are no records for that order in the wdd table.


Check why?
In the actions -> additional line info -> holds tab, I am not seeing any holds as well.

Tried to Progress the order from the actions tab -> but did not work as well.


The released status 'R' in wsh_delivery_details means -> Ready to Release.

Wsh_delivery_assignments. Wdd.delivery_details_id



-- My order went to awaiting shipping -> don't know why -> is there a program scheduled --> check/ask
-- Check what this program does -> NCRPLREGPICKSHIP -> (NCR PL REGULAR PICK SHIP PRINT)

ESUATA Order -> 179942285

Steps for SO ->
Step1 ) . Book the order.
In this step the tables ooha, oola will be populated.
Once the order goes to 'Awaiting shipping' in oola table, then wdd table will also be populated, it will not be populated if the order shows Booked in oola.

Wsh_delivery_details.source_header_id = ooha.header_id

Now, the wda (wsh_delivery_assignments) will be populated  once order goes to 'AS'. 
Wsh_delivery_assignments wda.delivery_detail_id = wdd.delivery_detail_id.

For now, the delivery id will be null in wda.


It will be populated once the order is pick released . For that, we will have to 'Launch Pick Release'… TBC


SO Status -> Entered -> Booked -> Awaiting Shipping (Ready to Release) -> 

RELEASE THE ORDER


When we release the order, the inventory people will release the item and will move it to staging area.

The status will be changed in wdd from 'R' -> 'Y'. Y means 'Pick Released' not 'Pick Confirmed'.


For now, the status is 'Ready to Release' which can be seen from Shipping Transactions form as well. Now, we will 'Pick Release' the order.



For that, go to 'Actions' tab on Shipping Transactions -> 'Launch Pick Release'. It will submit a CP 'Pick Selection List Generation' which will 'Pick Release' the order.


On successful completion of this program, the order will show 'Staged/Pick Confirmed'. The released_status for that is 'Y' in the wdd table.


R means Ready to Release.

S means Pick Released not Pick Confirmed.

Y means Pick Confirmed.




On being Staged/Pick Confirmed, the delivery_id will be generated for this order in the wsh_delivery_assignments table as well.






Once the order is 'Pick Confirmed', one more table will be reflected -> 'mtl_reservations' which means that the items are reserved for the customer.

The items are coming from inventory and will be located in staging area which means items are reserved for the customer.

The reserved quantity for an item for a customer can be checked in mtl_reservations mr table.



mr.DEMAND_SOURCE_LINE_ID = oola.LINE_ID


Also, this new entry will be there in the mtl_new_deliveries mnd table.

Mtl_new_deliveries.delivery_id = wsh_delivery_assignments.delivery_id



Also, the status_code is 'Open' which means that the items are waiting for the shipping.


Now, the next step is Ship Confirm


For doing that, go to Shipping Transactions -> Delivery tab -> 'Ship Confirm'. It will submit a number of programs which will change the status of order to 'Shipped' and also the lines will be added to delivery details.




The program, 'Interface Trip Stop' will be called on doing 'Ship Confirm'.




The status will show 'Closed' in the 'Shipping Transactions' -> 'Delivery' tab .

The 'Path By Stop' details will also be populated as follows.







'Path By Trip' details will also be populated. Also check 'Order Organizer' and 'Sales Order' forms.









There are no Invoices as of now.




The flow status code in ooha and oola tables changed to Closed. 






The released_status in wdd changed to 'C' means Shipped.



In wsh_delivery_assignments, the status changed to CL -> completed(maybe)



In mtl_reservations, there will be no record for this order because there are no reservations now i.e. the order has been shipped. It will only show the older transaction.







First, 1 item is removed from inventory and moved to staging area that's why -1.
Then, staging area , then transportation. Their sum is -1 , that is the final transaction quantity.



The item goes from inventory to staging area then to transportation.


Once, it is completed, the data is then Interfaced which can be checked in the Order Organizer -> View Delivery Details tab.

Effected tables -> 
	1. oe_order_headers_all
	2. oe_order_lines_all
	3. Wsh_delivery_details
	4. Wsh_delivery_asssignments
	5. mtl_reservations  -- The item info will be removed from here once item is shipped and order is closed.
	6. Mtl_onhand_quantities_detail
	7. Mtl_material_transactions
	
	
Now, our order is fulfilled, we are trying to generate the Invoice now.

Invoicing is a critical step in the O2C process, as it represents the company's request for payment from the customer. The invoice must be accurate, complete, and easy to understand to ensure that the customer can make a timely payment.


For that submit the 'WorkFlow Background Process' Program.

Once the order is closed, the delivery line status is 'Interfaced'.

	

	

Now, the data will be waiting in the Interface table. Table -> RA_INTERFACE_LINES_ALL rila


Rila.Interface_Line_Attribute1 = ooha.Order_Number


For now, there are no entries in ra_interface_lines_all table.

We need to run the 'Workflow Background Process' to create the entry here.

For now, we do not have any invoice information.

Run 'Workflow Background Process'.


	

We still do not see any invoice generated and no records are there in the ra_interface_lines_all table.

Submit one more program -> Workflow Background Process -> this time with Item Type as 'OM Order Line'.

Still the Invoice is not generated -> Ask Ana or Nishikant Sir.

TBC…


Oe_order_holds_all table
Y if the Order is released, N the Order is not released.



Interface
Now once the order is closed, it gets interfaced and it goes in the ra_interface_lines_all rila table.

In application  -> Order Organizer -> Lines -> Addition Line Info -> Delivery Tab -> View Delivery Details



So, as we can see the line status has been interfaced now as shown in the delivery tab.

The data should have flown to ra_interface_lines_all table but it did not for some reason.

Select rila.* from ra_interface_lines_all rila where INTERFACE_LINE_ATTRIBUTE1 = 181046113;


Also, we do not have any invoice information, so for that we are going to run 'Workflow Background Processor'.


For that go to view -> re -> submit new re and run 'Workflow Background Process' and choose Item Type => 'OM Order Line' or 'OM Standard'.

We choose OM Order Line because we want to generate Invoice for Order Line only.

Process deferred -> Y , timeout -> Y.

Once this program is completed successfully, the our Order will start reflecting in ra_interface_lines_all table.

Data did not reflect, still…

Pick an order for which the records are already there in ra_interface_lines_all…


When we create the order, the data comes to all the OM oe and wdd tables and on running Workflow Background Processor, the data flows through interaface (ra_interface_lines_all) tables and then to the ar_invoice base tables.

Data from interface table to ar base table flows when Workflow Background Processor calls 'AutoInvoice Background Processor' program.

Now, when we check the data in ra_interface_lines_all tables, the data will not be available as it must have flown to the ar base tables on completion of Workflow Background Processor.


--------------------------  ACCOUNT RECEIVABLE ---------------------------------------

Now, go to Receivables Vision Operations (USA) -> Transactions -> Transactions and search your order number there… we will see that the invoice will be generated for our Order.

It can be searched from ra_customer_trx_all where trx_number = invoice_number;

New order -> 181046114



The item goes from inventory to staging area then to transportation.


Once, it is completed, the data is then Interfaced which can be checked in the Order Organizer -> View Delivery Details tab.
